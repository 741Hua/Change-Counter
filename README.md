# Change-Counter
A MATLAB Image Processing Project that counts the amount of change in an image.

---------------To use this program download the image and .m file into the same folder---------------------

This .m file inputs the image provided in this repository and calculates the size of each coin to determine their values.

Note: this program will not work with any other image. Currently working on a more robust program that detects the type of coin based on its features rather than size.
